 Introduction
 
"Customer churn" means when a customer stops using a service. In this project, I used Microsoft Fabric and Machine Learning to predict which patients might not come back to the hospital.

I worked with sample hospital data, which included patient visits, complaints, and payment history. My goal was to find patterns in the data and help hospitals understand patient behavior so they can improve their services.

 Objectives
 
Fix hospital data by filling in missing information and correcting mistakes.

Use Machine Learning to predict which patients might not return.

Create charts and graphs to make the data easier to understand.

Use Microsoft Fabric to make the whole process automatic.

# Technology Stack Used
